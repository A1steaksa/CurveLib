# CurveLib

*All the fun of a graphing calculator, **now** in desktop form!*

This library adds arbitrary, user-defined Curves as a drop-in replacement for any of the [math.ease](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/math.ease) library's functions.

But Curves aren't all that helpful on their own, which is why this library also adds a Curve Editor window that can create, view, and edit curves at runtime, even while they are being actively evaluated.
